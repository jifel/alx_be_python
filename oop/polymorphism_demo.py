'''
Objective: Enhance your understanding of polymorphism in Python by creating a set of classes that demonstrate method overriding and polymorphic behavior.

Task Description:
You are tasked with creating a Python script named polymorphism_demo.py. In this script, define a base class Shape with a method area() and derived classes Rectangle and Circle, each overriding the area() method to calculate their respective areas.

polymorphism_demo.py:
Base Class - Shape:

Method: area(self), which simply raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that derived classes need to override this method.
Derived Class - Rectangle:

Inherits from Shape.
Attributes: length and width.
Overrides the area() method to calculate the rectangle’s area using the formula: length × width.
Derived Class - Circle:

Inherits from Shape.
Attributes: radius.
Overrides the area() method to calculate the circle’s area using the formula: π × radius² (use math.pi for π).
'''

import math

# Base Class
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must override the area method.")

# Derived Class - Rectangle
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

# Derived Class - Circle
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)
